# Product Card Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to create html elements and style them, manually with CSS.

The end product was supposed to resemble this wireframe
![Wireframe](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/images/SW_HTML_CSS_exercise.png?raw=true)

## To View

1. Clone repository to local machine.
1. Using http-server (`$ npm install http-server`) feed project to the port 8888 (`-p 8888`)
1. open localhost:8888 in your browsers address bar

## Notes

The CSS file uses FLEXBOX. If you are running this on Internet Explorer, the styling won't work properly
